            <p>PathPilot is a student-focused EdTech initiative designed to help school students discover the right career paths early, clearly, and confidently. Many students reach important academic decisions—such as choosing subjects or streams—without understanding their interests, strengths, or the opportunities available to them. This often leads to confusion, stress, and regret later in life. PathPilot aims to solve this problem by making career awareness simple, accessible, and understandable for everyone.</p>

            <p>Our platform is built with a clear mission: to provide free, easy-to-use career guidance for students from Classes 6 to 12. We focus especially on students who use basic smartphones or come from areas where professional career counseling is not easily available. By using simple technology and AI-assisted guidance, PathPilot presents career information in clear language, helping students explore options, understand requirements, and make informed choices.</p>

            <p>PathPilot is designed for three key groups:</p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Students</strong>, who need early and clear guidance about future careers</li>
                <li><strong>Parents</strong>, who want to support their children but may lack structured tools</li>
                <li><strong>Teachers</strong>, who wish to guide students but need simple, practical resources</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The platform provides career awareness content, categorized career paths, interactive quizzes, and an AI career guide—all without requiring any login or signup. This ensures that career guidance remains accessible, quick, and stress-free.</p>

            <p>At its core, PathPilot believes that the right guidance at the right time can change a student's entire future. By making career awareness free, simple, and mobile-friendly, we aim to empower students to choose paths that match their interests, skills, and dreams.</p>
